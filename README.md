# SportSee

This project is a sport application who display some graphics information about the results of their training, it's the number 12 from OpenClassroom project. The goal is to realised HTTP Calls and retrieve data from an API.
We should integrate graphics from rechart or D3. We don't need to make a responsive design just that the project is adaptable to 1024 x 780 pixels. 
To start the project mocked the api and as soon as the project is functional we can integrate the API.
